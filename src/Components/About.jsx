                <p>
                    I am a software developer with over 5 years of professional experience.
                    I am most experienced with - and I most prefer - modern C++, Python, and
                    Linux development environments. Outside of work, I enjoy a number of
                    different hobbies that include game development (and gaming), tinkering
                    with my 3D printer, roasting coffee, cooking, learning to play new musical
                    instruments, and starting new projects before completing my last one.

                    <br />
                    Feel free to contact me if you would like to chat. I am always open to new
                    opportunities, making new connections, or discussing similar interest!
